## _Incognita: A Portrait of Antarctica_
My current book project is a work of narrative nonfiction about the Antarctic. _Incognita: A Portrait of Antarctica_ tells the story of this awesome and fragile region through natural and human history, accounts of current scientific research, and artistic responses to the seventh continent. The project has been supported by a postdoctoral <a href="https://environment.harvard.edu/people/marissa-elizabeth-grunes" target="_blank">Environmental Fellowship</a> through Harvard's Center for the Environment and by the <a href="https://www.aauw.org/" target="_blank">American Association of University Women</a>.
