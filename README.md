## Incognita: A Portrait of Antarctica
My current book project is a work of narrative nonfiction about the Antarctic. Incognita: A Portrait of Antarctica tells the story of this awesome and fragile region through natural and human history, accounts of current scientific research, and artistic responses to the seventh continent.
